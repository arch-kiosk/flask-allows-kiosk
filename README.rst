This is simply a fork of flask-allows that merged all necessary pull requests to make it compatible with flask 2.


flask-allows
============

Are your permissions making too much noise all the time? Are your permissions
stomping all over your actual code? Are your permission decorators clawing
at your line count all the time? Think there's no answer? There is! Flask-Allows.


Flask-Allows is an authorization tool for Flask inspired by
`django-rest-framework <https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework>`_'s
permissioning system and `rest_condition <https://github.com/caxap/rest_condition>`_'s
ability to compose simple requirements into more complex ones.

Installation
------------

Don't use pip install flask-allows. Rather clone this and then install flask-allows locally.
